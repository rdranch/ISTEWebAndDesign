			<p> This place sucked. I did one club sport while there: tennis. It didn't go well. </p>
			<p> Located in Scarsdale, NY </p>
			<p> Small school ~1-2k. You started off knowing everyone in Kindergarten and that goes through 12th grade. It was awful </p>
			<p> The only credit I can give it was the teachers were actually somewhat decent compared to other schools </p>
