					I am part of the RITSEC club at RIT. I used to frequently attend meeting but that hasn't happened as often since COVID began. Besides RITSEC,
					I do a lot of security work which has led to me participating in 2 RITSEC competitions.

					I've been doing MMA (boxing, wrestling) since I was pretty young. It used to be 'self-defense' for me but as I'm older and don't usually
					scrap it out with people, it's become sort of an exercise. I'm pretty good at it if I do say so myself. I think the big issue for people is they
					are scared to get hit and to hit but you need the attitude to fight or you'll never get good.

					In my free time, I play video games. I think this is pretty typical for any security student, especially ones at RIT. Been doing it since I
					was old enough to use a computer. Good times.
