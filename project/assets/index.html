				<h2>This sites mission and purpose</h2>
				<p>This site was created for the purpose of introducing myself and completing my ISTE 140 project one assignment. Hopefully, in the future, I will turn 
				this into a custom blog post for security of some sort. Please let me know if you have some good future suggestions.</p>

			<div class="audience">
				<h2>This sites audience</h2>
				<p>Hopefully, if you're reading this you're the professor but in the future, I plan to change this into something that employers and
				other security analysts looking to learn about something interesting in the field can turn to.</p>
