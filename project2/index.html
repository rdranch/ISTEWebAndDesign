				<h3>PewDiePie's channel was the most subscribed channel from 2013 to 2019</h3>
				<p> Following an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PewDiePie_vs_T-Series" target="_blank">intense battle</a> with T-Series, a company based in India, PewDiePie lost his title as most subscribed YouTuber. However, he has since continued to grow and releases videos and livestreams on Youtube consistently.</p>
				<p>In 2016, <em>Time</em> named PewDiePie one of the top 100 most influential people in the world. <em>TC Candler</em> has consistently placed him in the top 20 most handsome men since 2016, and in 2020, he was placed as number one.</p> 
				<p>Much of PewDiePie's success can be linked to his viral videos, songs, and bright personality. He shows the platform that he isn't afraid to say what he thinks and acknowledges mistakes that he has made. He has also gone on to donate generously to various charities and fundraisers. What isn't known to many is that PewDiePie actually started off his career as a hotdog salesman and he frequently jokes about this in some of his newer videos. It is the actual 'rags to riches' story considering this influencer is now the most well-known person on most platforms.</p>
				<p>Many influencers and creators find success through their involvement with other members of the community. PewDiePie's following gives him a spotlight of attention for other creators looking to grow on the platform. Some of his main friends are Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, CinnamonToastKen, and RoomieOfficial.</p>
