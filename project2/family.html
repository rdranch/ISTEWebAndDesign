				<h4>Edgar and Maya</h4>
				<p>Edgar is PewDiePie's 3rd dog and the one that gets the most attention. He is jokingly named after Edgar Allan Poe (Edgar Allan Pug). Edgar was born in 2012 and has widely been featured as a character in PewDiePie's videos, games and shows. He is a beloved pet to both PewDiePie and his audience.</p>
				<p>Maya is PewDiePie's 2nd dog and previously gained most of her attention in Marzia's channel. She is called both Maya and Puga among them. She was born in 2015 and one can notice that she is missing her left eye. This is due to an incident when she was a pup in Vietnam. According to PewDiePie, she has gone blind. Similar to Edgar, she is featured in many of PewDiePie's videos, games and shows.</p>
